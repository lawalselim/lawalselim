About me <br>
With over five years of experience encompassing both engineering and management roles, I am a dedicated Technical Product Manager deeply passionate about transforming ideas into captivating, user-centric experiences. My enthusiasm lies in crafting seamless interactions that not only engage but also delight users. Witnessing the fruition of applications I've developed is immensely rewarding, motivating me to excel further in my craft.

My expertise revolves around translating design concepts into impeccably responsive websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Typescript. Throughout my career, I've thrived in diverse organisational settings and challenging projects, continuously evolving my skill set. Proficient in modern frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Node.js, I consistently seek new technologies and stay attuned to industry trends to deliver innovative solutions.

Beyond coding, I actively contribute to open-source initiatives and produce technical content to give back to the tech community. My professional drive is complemented by exceptional communication and time management skills, enabling me to excel in both collaborative environments and self-directed projects.
